Step 1: Key Theme and Idea
Title: "The Essence of Being: Life Beyond Definitions"

Key Theme: The speech will delve into the philosophical and scientific exploration of human existence, challenging the conventional views of defining life as static and urging the audience to embrace a dynamic perspective that sees "being" as an ongoing process.

Step 2: Captivating Openings

1. "Imagine a world where we aren't just 'things' defined by labels, but processes in perpetual motion. Now, let me take you on a journey through this lens."
   
2. "Have you ever wondered if you're more than the sum of your parts? More than a static entity in a dynamic universe?"

3. "What if I told you that you are not a thing, but a verb, an action, always becoming, never complete?"

4. "Look at yourself. Not just at your reflection in the mirror, but at the constellation of processes that makes you who you are. Intrigued?"

5. "How would our perspective on life change if we considered ourselves not as beings, but as 'beings in progress'?"

Step 3: Structure of the Body

1. Introduction to the concept of 'being' as an ongoing process.
2. Scientific perspective: the biology of human growth, cell regeneration, and psychological development.
3. Philosophical discussion on identity, constant change, and the fluidity of self.
4. How societal and cultural definitions limit our understanding of existence.
5. Real-world implications of seeing ourselves as processes; in health, relationships, and personal growth.

Step 4: Rhetorical Devices and Storytelling Techniques

- Metaphor: Compare the dynamic state of human existence to the never-ending evolution of the universe.
- Analogy: Relate the human existence to a story that is continuously being written and rewritten, rather than a book with a fixed ending.
- Vivid imagery: Describe the symphony of cellular activity that occurs within us every moment, illustrating the dance of life on a microscopic level.

Step 5: Powerful Ending

"Today, we've traveled through the corridors of our existence and found them to be in constant motion. You are not just a 'thing'; you are a 'becoming,' an endless weave of stories, experiences, and transformations. So, I leave you with this question: Will you embrace the process and become the author of your own evolving story?"
